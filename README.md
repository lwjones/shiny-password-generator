# Shiny Password Generator

## Description

Need a password in a pinch? The Shiny Password Generator gets you a password quick!

This project was started to build familiarity with programming in Javascript. Generally learning the specifics of Javascript reflects similarly to other languages such as C++ which makes the transition easy. However it has been utilizing browser/window functions that are new to learn.

Moveover, Javascript has string literals, which allow you to perform string interpolation via the backtick. When given a variable **price** a value of `9.99`, we can print it out without having to do multiple contatinations.

```javascript
console.log(`Current price $${price} usd`); // > Current price $9.99 usd
```

Overall, this is a little dabble into the incredible power Javascript has, and I can't wait to get started on another project!
